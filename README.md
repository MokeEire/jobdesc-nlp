# What is this?
A little exploration of text analysis using job descriptions.

I wanted to see which key words were showing up most often in the kinds of jobs I was applying to. 
This seemed like a perfect opportunity to get my feet wet with text analysis in Python, and I wanted to make a wordcloud to make the analysis easily interpretable visually.

It is a simple script, and doesn't dive into text analysis deeply at all (the lemmatization needs some examination).
Hopefully it is a useful starting point for anyone trying to identify key words and ensure they are not leaving out crucial terms in their job search.
